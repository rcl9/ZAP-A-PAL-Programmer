     This version of ZAP-A-PAL is set up to take JEDEC files for PALs which use the
whole fuse array, like 16L8 etc. Sparse array PALs like the 10L8, 14H4, etc. can
be programmed, but you have to edit the JEDEC fuse file to put in the phantom
fuses that most logic compilers leave out in a misguided attempt at efficiency.

To see what the JEDEC file should look like, put a blank sparse PAL into the
socket and (R)ead it into the buffer. Then look at the fuse array with (Y).
The phantom fuses appear as blown. Those columns should be edited into the
JEDEC file produced by the Logic compiler before being loaded into ZAPAL.

You then have to correct the fuze numbers in the JEDEC file to conform to the
full fuse array after editing. Phantom rows are normally supplied by ZAPAL.
The diagrams for sparse array PALs in the PAL Handbook show this clearly.
Don't worry that editing the JEDEC file will blow the checksum. ZAP-A-PAL doesn't
bother to verify the checksum in the JEDEC file anyway. Later versions of ZAP-A-PAL 
will tweek the fusemap for sparse PALs for you, but hey, I had to leave
something to challenge the hobbiest. It'd be no fun if I did everything for you.
Besides, if you stick with 16L8, 16R4-6-8, 20L8, etc. like I do, ZAP-A-PAL works OK.

Another thing to watch is that your logic compiler produces the proper polarity
for true output PALs like 14H4 or 10H8. You may have to invert the sense of the
fuse in this program if it is incorrect.
